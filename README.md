# 🌱 Machine Learning Studies

Welcome to my personal repository for learning and experimenting with **machine learning**.

Here, you'll find notebooks, scripts, and notes from my journey into the intersection of biology, computation, and other variate uses of data analysis. I'm a biological sciences undergraduate at Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), researching microbial ecology with a deep curiosity for how machine learning can help unravel hidden patterns in genomic data and ecological networks.
